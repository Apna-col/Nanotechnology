        <h2><u>Introduction to Nanotechnology</u></h2>
        <p>Nanotechnology is a field that deals with materials and structures at the nanoscale, typically with dimensions
            less than 100 nanometers. It has applications in various scientific and technological domains.Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter on a near-atomic scale to produce new structures, materials and devices. The technology promises scientific advancement in many sectors such as medicine, consumer products, energy, materials, and manufacturing.</p>

        <h2><u>History of Nanotechnology</u></h2>
        <p>In 1959 the American Nobel prize and physicist Richard Feynman was the first to speak about the applications of nanotechnology at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). With the 21st century, this area consolidated, was marketed and came into its own. It includes other areas such as micro-manufacturing, organic chemistry and molecular biology. In the United States alone, for example, more than 18 billion dollars were invested between 2001 and 2013 through the NNI (National Nanotechnology Initiative) to turn this sector into a driver of economic growth and competitiveness.</p>

 

  <h2><u> Progress of Nanotechnology</u></h2>
<p>Nanotechnology and its microscopic universe offer gigantic possibilities for contemporary science and industry. This field, which flourished between the 60s and 80s, has surged in the last two decades with a booming global market whose value will exceed 125,000 million dollars in the next five years according to the Global Nanotechnology Market (by Component and Applications) report by Research & Markets which presents forecasts for 2024.</h2>

   <h2><u>Types of Nanotechnology</u></h2>
<p>The different types of nanotechnology are classified according to how they proceed (top-down or bottom-up) and the medium in which they work (dry or wet):</p>
   <ul>
<li><u>Descending (top-down)</u>:
Mechanisms and structures are miniaturised at the nanometric scale — from one to 100 nanometres in size —. It is the most frequent to date, especially in electronics.</li>
<br>

<li><u>Ascending (bottom-up)</u>

You start with a nanometric structure — a molecule, for example — and through a mounting or self-assembly process you create a larger mechanism than the one you started with.</li>
<br>
<li><u>Dry nanotechnolgy</u>

It is used to manufacture structures in coal, silicon, inorganic materials, metals and semiconductors that do not work with humidity.</li>
<br>
<li><u>Wet nanotechnology</u>
It is based on biological systems present in an aqueous environment — including genetic material, membranes, enzymes and other cellular components —.</li>

<h2><u>Study of Nanotechnology</u></h2>

<ol>
<li><u>Educational Background</u>:

Obtain a solid foundation in the basic sciences, including physics, chemistry, and biology. A bachelor's degree in a related field such as physics, chemistry, engineering, or materials science is typically required.</li>

<br>
<li><u>Specialized Degrees</u>:

Consider pursuing advanced degrees such as a master's or Ph.D. in nanotechnology or a related field. Many universities offer specialized programs in nanoscience or nanotechnology.</li>

 <br>
            <li><u>Energy</u>:A new semiconductor developed by Kyoto University makes it possible to manufacture solar panels that double the amount of sunlight converted into electricity. Nanotechnology also lowers costs, produces stronger and lighter wind turbines, improves fuel efficiency and, thanks to the thermal insulation of some nanocomponents, can save energy.</li>

 <br>
            <li><u>Materials Science</u>:Nanotechnology makes it possible to develop smart fabrics that don't stain nor wrinkle, as well as stronger, lighter and more durable materials to make motorcycle helmets or sports equipment.</li>

 <br>
            <li><u>Environmental Protection</u>:Air purification with ions, wastewater purification with nanobubbles or nanofiltration systems for heavy metals are some of its environmentally-friendly applications. Nanocatalysts are also available to make chemical reactions more efficient and less polluting.In this field, nanobiosensors could be used to detect the presence of pathogens in food or nanocomposites to improve food production by increasing mechanical and thermal resistance and decreasing oxygen transfer in packaged products.</li>
        </ul>

<br></p>
<p>It's important to note that while nanotechnology offers many benefits, there are also concerns about its potential environmental and health risks, and ethical considerations must be taken into account in its development and application.</p>

    <h2><u> Harmful effects of Nanotechnology</u> </h2>
  
   <p>As there are many good things about nanotechnology so there are many bad effects of nanotechnology as well. Nano pollution refers to the contamination of the environment with nanomaterials, which are particles that have at least one dimension measuring between 1 and 100 nanometers. These nanomaterials can be intentionally produced for various purposes, such as in the manufacturing of consumer products, or they can be byproducts of industrial processes. Nano pollution can occur in air, water, and soil.</p>

<p>Nanoparticles possess unique properties due to their small size, which can lead to enhanced reactivity and different biological interactions compared to larger particles of the same material. While nanotechnology offers numerous benefits, the potential environmental and health risks associated with the release of nanoparticles into the environment have raised concerns.</p>

<h2><u>Sources of Nano pollution</u></h2>

  <p>The sources of nano pollution include industries that use nanomaterials in manufacturing processes, consumer products containing nanoparticles (like sunscreens, electronics, and clothing), and accidental releases during the disposal or recycling of nanomaterial-containing products. The impact of nano pollution on ecosystems and human health is still an active area of research, as the behavior and effects of nanoparticles in the environment can vary depending on factors such as size, shape, composition, and surface properties.</p>

   <h2><u>Nanotechnology in Future</u></h2>

   <p>There are bright and dark spots in the future of nanotechnology. On the one hand, the sector is expected to grow globally, driven by technological advances, increased government support, increased private investment and growing demand for smaller devices, to name a few. However, the environmental, health and safety risks of nanotechnology and concerns related to its commercialisation could hamper market expansion.

The United States, Brazil and Germany will lead the nanotechnology industry in 2024, with an important presence in the Top 15 Asian countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, India, Taiwan and Malaysia. The cosmetics sector will climb positions stealing third place from the biomedical sector in a ranking that will be led by electronics and energy, as it is now.</p>
